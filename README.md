# web-scraping-challenge

Note that the pulling of the data when pressing takes a while.  additionally, when you go to the /pull_data page, it will say the site can't be reached.  it stays on this page for a good 30 seconds, but will eventually go back to the home page with all of my data on it.

Thanks!
